# ArtsParts

ArtsParts is a funny way to share your favorite part of an artwork.

# Twitter

The app uses twitter for login or sharing picture. All the picture parts are not stored localy. Everything will be uploaded to twitter and stored there. All the results are then just availiable over the tweets of the user.

Not only the user needs a own account also the running app needs to be registered at twitter.

Also every artwork is going to be tweeted by the app over the connected twitter account. At this point it is important to check that the license of the uploaded pictures allow it to share them over the twitter account.
